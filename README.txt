README

I'm not really a programmer so versioning isn't really happening here, this is just a project I've been working on that I feel has matured enough to share with the world. 
I will upload a database schema for MySQL shortly.

My web server never sees the outside world so it's loosely set up.

Here are the environment details for the web/sql host:

Server 2012 R2 with IIS, PHP, and MySQL installed, PHP was installed from within the IIS console, MySQL was latest stable release from their home page.

Dependencies:

Powershell code (committed)
MySQL Connector assembly for .net
VMWare powerCLI
Citrix XenApp Management Powershell Snapin (comes with default install of Session host)
